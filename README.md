# Computer Vision Mini Projects

This repository contains my journey into **Computer Vision** through hands-on mini projects and programs. These projects are inspired by my learning experience with [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and serve as a practical exploration of various concepts in Computer Vision.

## 🏗️ About the Repository

Each project is designed to:
- Strengthen foundational knowledge in Computer Vision.
- Apply theoretical concepts to real-world scenarios.
- Build a portfolio of diverse, functional programs.

Feel free to explore, use, or contribute to the code in this repository!

## 📁 Project Structure

Each project is stored in a separate folder and includes:
- **Code files:** Written in Python using popular libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, etc.
- **Resources:** Images, datasets, or files used for testing (if applicable).
- **Documentation:** Detailed explanations of the project, its goals, and implementation.
